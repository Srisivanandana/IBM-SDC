Here's a detailed analysis with actionable recommendations:\n","\n","\n","**1. Structure & Formatting:**\n","\n","* **Add a Professional Summary/Objective:** Instead of a simple statement, craft a compelling summary highlighting quantifiable achievements and career aspirations.  For example:  \"Results-oriented Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience building and deploying scalable web applications. Proven ability to design and implement RESTful APIs, enhance user experience with React.js, and streamline development processes through CI/CD implementation. Seeking a challenging role in a fast-paced environment where I can leverage my skills in full-stack development and contribute to innovative projects.\"  Tailor this to each job application.\n","* **Expand Experience Section:** Use the accomplishment-based STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to showcase achievements within each role.  Quantify results whenever possible (e.g., \"Improved API response time by 15%,\" \"Reduced bug count by 20%\").  Avoid using just task descriptions (e.g., \"Built REST APIs\").\n","* **Add Projects Section (if applicable):**  Include personal projects showcasing your skills and initiative.  GitHub links are highly recommended.\n","* **Use Keywords:**  Incorporate relevant keywords from job descriptions for better ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility.\n","* **Improve Formatting:** Use bullet points consistently, bolding key accomplishments or technologies. Consider using a modern, clean resume template.  Ensure consistent spacing and font.\n","\n","\n","**2. Skills (Missing or Outdated):**\n","\n","* **Expand Technical Skills:**  The current skill list is too brief.  Add more specific skills relevant to software engineering and potentially data science, depending on your target roles. This might include:\n","    * **Specific databases:**  (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, Redis)  Instead of just SQL.\n","    * **Cloud platforms:** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)  Mention specific services used (e.g., AWS Lambda, EC2).\n","    * **Testing frameworks:** (e.g., Jest, pytest, Selenium)\n","    * **Version control (beyond Git):**  Mention branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow).\n","    * **Containerization (beyond Docker):**  Kubernetes experience is highly valuable.\n","    * **Data science tools (if applicable):**  Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn; data visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn; big data technologies like Spark or Hadoop (if relevant).\n","* **Soft Skills:** Include relevant soft skills such as teamwork, communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, and adaptability.\n","\n","\n","**3. Language (Tone, Clarity):**\n","\n","* **Stronger Verbs:** Replace weak verbs like \"built\" and \"worked on\" with stronger action verbs that highlight your accomplishments (e.g., \"Developed,\" \"Implemented,\" \"Architected,\" \"Optimized,\" \"Improved\").\n","* **Quantifiable Results:**  Always quantify your achievements whenever possible. Use numbers to demonstrate the impact of your work.\n","* **Conciseness:**  Avoid jargon and unnecessary words.  Keep your language clear and concise.\n","\n","\n","**4. Job Alignment (Software Engineering/Data Science):**\n","\n","* **Target Specific Roles:** Tailor your resume to each job application.  Highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to the specific role's requirements.\n","* **Data Science Focus (if applicable):** If targeting data science roles, significantly expand your skills section to include relevant data science tools and techniques, and highlight projects involving data analysis, modeling, or machine learning.\n","* **Full-Stack Emphasis (if desired):** If targeting full-stack roles, clearly demonstrate your expertise in both front-end and back-end development with specific examples.\n","\n","\n","**Actionable Recommendations in Bullet Points:**\n","\n","* **Rewrite Summary:**  Create a compelling summary highlighting quantifiable achievements and career goals.\n","* **Expand Experience:** Use the STAR method to describe accomplishments with quantifiable results for each role at TechCorp. Add a new section for projects with details and ideally GitHub links.\n","* **Add Skills:**  Expand your technical skills list with specific technologies and tools, including cloud platforms, testing frameworks, and potentially data science tools (depending on target roles). Include soft skills.\n","* **Improve Verb Choice:** Replace weak verbs with stronger action verbs.\n","* **Quantify Achievements:**  Use numbers and metrics to demonstrate the impact of your work.\n","* **Tailor to Job Description:** Customize your resume for each application, highlighting the most relevant skills and experiences.\n","* **Proofread Carefully:**  Ensure your resume is free of grammatical errors and typos.\n","* **Use a Professional Template:** Choose a clean and modern resume template.\n","\n","\n","By implementing these recommendations, John Doe's resume will be significantly stronger and more effective in securing interviews for software engineering and data science roles.\n"]}],"source":["!pip install -q google-generativeai\n","\n","import google.generativeai as genai\n","\n","# Configure Gemini with your API key\n","GOOGLE_API_KEY = \"AIzaSyDuSZxPH--lMe0rNoj-afyeKezzYcnF8Bk\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n","genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n","\n","# Initialize the Gemini model\n","model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')\n","\n","def evaluate_resume(resume_text: str) -> str:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Analyzes a resume and provides improvement suggestions using Gemini.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        resume_text: The resume content to analyze\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        Detailed suggestions for improvement\n","    \"\"\"\n","    prompt = \"\"\"\n","    You are a professional career advisor and resume reviewer.
